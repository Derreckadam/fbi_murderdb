title: "FBI MurdeR Analysis Notebook"
output: html_notebook

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook analyzing FBI reported murders from [Murder Accountability Project](www.murderdata.org/p/data-docs.html). When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 


```{r, murderperyear}
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
murder_db <- read_csv("murder_db.csv")

ggplot(murder_db, aes(x=murder_db$))

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
