This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook analyzing FBI reported murders from [Murder Accountability Project](www.murderdata.org/p/data-docs.html). When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

The state data came from [here](https://www.infoplease.com/us/states/state-population-by-rank)

```{r, murderperyear}
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)

murder_db <- read_csv("murder_db.csv")
state_pop <- read_csv("statepops.csv")
state_murders<-as.data.frame(table(murder_db$State))
colnames(state_murders)<-c("State", "Counts")
state_info <- merge(state_pop, state_murders, by="State")
state_info$Population<-as.numeric(state_info$Population)
state_info$Counts<-as.numeric(state_info$Counts)
state_info$"percapita"<-state_info$Counts/state_info$Population

ggplot(state_info, aes(State, percapita)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = .1)) 



```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
